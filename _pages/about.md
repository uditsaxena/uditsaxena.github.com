Hi! I'm Udit Saxena. 

I am a machine learning engineer at [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) with the Advanced Analytics team.
I've completed my Master's in Computer Science from UMass, Amherst. My interests lie in the field of Machine Learning - specifically Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning.
    
At Sumo, I work on building distributed fast approximate strucutured and unstructured streaming clustering algorithms for text streams, time series models and clustering algorithms for peer-based component/workload modeling and security event analysis. 
Previously I've interned with Sumo Logic, working on [Distributed Tracing](http://opentracing.io/documentation/), in the Bay Area with the metrics team led by [David Andrzejewski](http://www.david-andrzejewski.com/).
Before this I worked as a Product Engineer with the Core team at [Sprinklr](http://www.sprinklr.com) and have interned with [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/in/) on User Analytics with the Adobe Captivate team.
    
During Spring 2018, I was [working](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tzyhlQBIzi2rBTOM0YclZEZV-IN6fqNM) with Microsoft Research team at Montreal and Cambridge on Active Learning for transferring knowledge for Reading Comprehension systems with [T.J. Hazen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-j-hazen-9897682/). 
I have also interned at [Lexalytics](https://www.lexalytics.com/) as a Machine Learning intern where my focus was on Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification.
I've worked on a Pytorch implementation of [End to End Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895), which is currently open as a [pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/pull/191) on the official Pytorch examples repository. 
In Spring 2017, I [worked](https://github.com/iesl/factorie-tf-model-serve) with [Prof. Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) on serving pre-trained Tensorflow models for the JVM as part of [IESL](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/).
I was a Google Summer of Code intern, working with [MLPACK](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) (along with [Ryan Curtin](http://www.ratml.org/)), a C++ based open source machine learning library.
