Hi! I'm Udit Saxena. 

I am a **Lead Machine Learning Engineer** at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/), where I design large-scale AI infrastructure for Generative AI systems.

At ASAPP, I build **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems** and **multi-turn conversational agent platforms** that power enterprise-scale voice and text AI products. 

My work spans workflow orchestration (Airflow, Spark, Kubernetes), LLM evaluation and inference infrastructure, and distributed deep learning training. I collaborate closely with our Research, Product, Platform, and SRE teams to bridge cutting-edge LLM research with production systems. 

I also spoke at **Airflow Summit 2024**, sharing how ASAPP orchestrates large-scale batch inference for gen-AI workloads across Kubernetes clusters ([Airflow Blog](https://medium.com/apache-airflow/airflow-at-asapp-enhancing-ai-powered-contact-centers-0328deb6f03b)).

Previously, as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/), I built fast and approximate streaming clustering algorithms for text streams and time series models, resulting in **two granted patents**.

My research spans natural language processing, geometric and topological deep learning, and sparse methods for model efficiency. I recently published [Scalable GPU-Accelerated Euler Characteristic Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20271) at **NeurIPS 2025** (NeurReps Workshop) — introducing optimized, differentiable topological features for **PyTorch with 16–2000× GPU speedups** on modern architectures.

Earlier, in [A Unified Paths Perspective For Pruning at Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10552) with Thomas Gebhart, we studied how neural network path structure relates to pruning using the Neural Tangent Kernel framework.
    
Before that, I worked with Microsoft Research, Lexalytics, UMass IESL, Google Summer of Code ([MLPACK](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack)), Sprinklr, and Adobe on topics ranging from [active learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tzyhlQBIzi2rBTOM0YclZEZV-IN6fqNM) to graph neural networks for text.

I enjoy the intersection of AI systems, distributed computing, and geometric ML, and I’m always interested in building tools and infrastructure that make large models more efficient, interpretable, and useful.
