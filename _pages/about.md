 Hi! I'm Udit Saxena. I am a machine learning engineer at [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) with the Advanced Analytics team.
    I've completed my Master's in Computer Science from UMass, Amherst. My interests lie in the field of Machine Learning - specifically Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning.
    
    At Sumo, I work on building time series models and clustering algorithms for peer-based component/workload modeling and security event analysis. 
    Previously I've interned with Sumo Logic, working on [Distributed Tracing](http://opentracing.io/documentation/), in the Bay Area with the metrics team led by [David Andrzejewski](http://www.david-andrzejewski.com/).
    Before this I worked as a Product Engineer with the Core team at [Sprinklr](http://www.sprinklr.com) and have interned with [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/in/) on User Analytics with the Adobe Captivate team.
    <h3>Research and Projects</h3>
    During Spring 2018, I was <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tzyhlQBIzi2rBTOM0YclZEZV-IN6fqNM">working with Microsoft Research team at Montreal and Cambridge on Active Learning for transferring knowledge for Reading Comprehension systems with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-j-hazen-9897682/">T.J. Hazen. 
    I have also interned at <a href="https://www.lexalytics.com/">Lexalytics as a Machine Learning intern where my focus was on Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification.
    I've worked on a Pytorch implementation of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895">End to End Memory Networks, which is currently open as a <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/examples/pull/191">pull request on the official Pytorch examples repository. 
    In Spring 2017, I <a href="https://github.com/iesl/factorie-tf-model-serve">worked with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof. Andrew McCallum on serving pre-trained Tensorflow models for the JVM as part of <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">IESL.
     I was a Google Summer of Code intern, working with <a href-"https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack">MLPACK (along with <a href="http://www.ratml.org/">Ryan Curtin), a C++ based open source machine learning library.
