The Poise of Dawn


The eyes, they say, have it all 
Here too, the maxim's true 
But, knowing her 
Rather a confining one 
To befall 

Screaming wanderlust, they grip you 
In their icy stare, 
In a passionate flare,  
But there are jewels 
To be found elsewhere 

let the carapace come off 
The strong but silent tenacity 
And the careful measured verbosity 
These she shrugs off, with a dancer's neck bob 
For jiggling feet and unmatched vivacity 

Here and there a stolen bellow, 
Still there though, the quiet grace,  
And oh, what a face! 
Careful, you might lose her though 
In the realms of a burgeoning bookcase 

She looks like herself, 
Wearing her strange beauty like war paint 
Strong and weak at once 
Allowing herself, at least for a little while 
To be both 


*(I'd written this in 2017 as part of three separate poems for three separate friends who I met in grad school (I'm still in touch with all of them). Posting it now because I had never put them up, as well as to keep my yearly quota up. I'm back-dating this even though the commit ID should provide the correct timestamp in gitlog.)*
