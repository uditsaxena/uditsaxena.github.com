I saw her first, white boots and all  
Through the buzz of bees  
We met, not too far from her garden  
On another planet, as if across  
Two celestial counties  

In a past life, a passion for the arts  
Oh, watch her belly dance, her hips sway  
She's the queen of (my) heart(s)  
In all of life's matters  
Even Russian ballet  

Not unlike my heart, in her curls  
A hummingbird takes flight  
Stubborn, as if against society's pearls  
Her hair, refusing to lay flat  
Without a fight  

Yosemite and Diablo, with her I've hiked far  
Even slid across ice without fear  
Oh, there's more than one bar  
(When she's not dancing on it)  
That she can clear  

With voice notes that could make you age  
Over long calls, we've cross-ed mini swords  
And spun a tapestry of letters  
As if speaking our very own secret language  
While wearing borrowed sweaters  

I fear how profoundly her absence would echo  
I fear now, the cruel twist of the knife of fate  
How stark the silence  
(No more Bollywood goss)  
That would refuse to dissipate  

She came to me like laughter, a roaring sea  
Taught me her language of dreams  
A sanctuary, rescuing me  
In the stillness of my dark night  
My solace, her fiercely gentle dynamite
