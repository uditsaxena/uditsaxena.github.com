An Unfamiliar Me


I greeted her on a starry night sky 
At the base of a dying tree 
With closed eyes, 
And a deep sigh 
I met an old but unfamiliar me 

Since then I have wondered 
Where her secret lies 
In the bend of her hair 
In her bottomless stare 
Nay, I say, in those dark pools some call eyes 

Lit this instant, doused the next 
Passionate, smoldering coals at the core 
Like an open door 
Like a curtain hiding 
All that came before 

A glint of a pageant crown 
Of students, playing with letters 
Intoxicating nights out about the town 
Slightly be mildly buzzed texts 
Ending in whatev(ers) 

Made of more spice than sugar 
Of puppies crooning to "Dilbar Dilbar" 
A coquettish grin here or there 
Defies her regal flair 
And silently bequeaths ownership to you 

The only thing that haunts me 
Is to be forgotten like a speck 
In her rear view mirror 
Too much truth, I fear 
Will, or may have already, ruin a good thing 

A part of me hopes for more 
Part of me still remains a fool 
She arrived with a storm not far behind her 
When she leaves (has she already?) 
I would know a before and after 


*(I'd written this in 2017 as part of three separate poems for three separate friends who I met in grad school (I'm still in touch with all of them). Posting it now because I had never put them up, as well as to keep my yearly quota up. I'm back-dating this even though the commit ID should provide the correct timestamp in gitlog.)*
